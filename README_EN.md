## 🎯 What is Dayflow?

**Dayflow** is an AI-powered time tracking tool for Windows. It quietly captures low-frequency screen activity and window context in the background, uses a vision model to infer what you are doing, and turns the result into a timeline, statistics dashboard, and reports so you can understand where your time actually goes.

### 💡 Who is it for?

- People who want to know where their day went
- People who want to review focus time, distractions, and work patterns
- People who need automatic activity logs, daily reports, or weekly summaries
- People who prefer passive tracking over manual timers

### 🏆 Key advantages

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Zero effort** | Start it and let AI handle activity recognition automatically |
| **Low overhead** | 1 FPS recording + smart compression to keep background usage low |
| **Local first** | Raw recordings stay on your machine and temporary chunks are cleaned up after analysis |
| **Smart categories** | Automatically detects work / study / entertainment / social / rest |
| **Visual review** | Timeline, statistics page, and HTML dashboard for different review styles |

---

## 🔐 Privacy, upfront

Dayflow is designed around **local recording + cloud analysis + local storage**.

### 5 things you should know

1. **Full videos are not uploaded**  
   Raw recording chunks stay on your local machine.

2. **Only a limited number of keyframes are sent for analysis**  
   The current README describes up to 8 extracted frames per chunk being sent to the configured vision model.

3. **Analysis results are stored locally**  
   Activities, settings, and statistics are saved in a local SQLite database.

4. **Temporary chunks are cleaned up automatically**  
   After analysis, temporary recording files are deleted to reduce disk usage.

5. **You can pause recording for sensitive moments**  
   Passwords, banking, private chats, or anything else sensitive can be handled by pausing recording first.

### Local data location

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dayflow\
├── dayflow.db      # activities, settings, stats
├── dayflow.log     # runtime logs
├── chunks\         # temporary recording chunks
└── updates\        # downloaded updates
```

> 💡 If privacy is your first concern, read this section before enabling continuous recording.

## 📖 Basic usage

### 1. Configure your API

Go to **Settings** and fill in:
- **API URL**: any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **API Key**
- **Model name**: a vision-capable model

Then click **Test Connection** and **Save Config**.

### 2. Start recording

- Click **Start Recording**
- The app records at 1 FPS in the background
- A video chunk is generated every 60 seconds
- Keyframes are sent to your configured model service for analysis

### 3. Review your timeline

Each card shows a time range, category, app, summary, and productivity score.

### 4. Optional features

- **Email reports**: scheduled summaries and deeper analysis
- **Auto start**: launch with Windows and minimize to tray
- **Auto update**: check and install new versions
- **System tray**: control recording without keeping the main window open

## Known limitations

- Windows 10 / 11 only
- Recognition quality depends on the vision model you configure
- Some apps may not expose stable window titles
- Full-screen games, special rendering windows, and remote desktop scenarios may behave differently
- Multi-monitor support still has room for improvement
- Analysis latency depends on your network and model provider stability
